    "- Proposed Method: K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "- I will use K-NN to predict if a player subscribes based on their experience, playtime, age, and gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why This Method is Good for Our Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can handle both numbers (playtime, age) and categories (experience, gender). For categories, just convert categories to numbers.\n",
    "- Doesn't require mathematical relationships between variables.\n",
    "- K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Classification is a better choice than regression because regression is designed to predict continuous numerical outcomes, like house prices or temperatures. However, the variable we are trying to predict, subscribe, is a categorical yes-or-no outcome (TRUE or FALSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Problems: \n",
    "- Needs Data Scaling: Playtime (0-223 hours) and age (9-58) are on different scales and must be adjusted\n",
    "- Sensitive to Neighbor Choice: Choosing the right number of similar players (k) is important\n",
    "- Class Imbalance: Since 80% of players subscribe, the model might just guess \"subscribe\" most times\n",
    "- Converting categories like \"Male\" and \"Non-binary\" into numbers falsely implies a mathematical order and distance between them, which would corrupt the model's distance calculations and lead to unreliable predictions. Therefore, to avoid introducing this distortion I will abandon the gender variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "How I'll Set Up the Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split Data: 70% for training, 30% for testing\n",
    "2. Fix Data Issues:\n",
    "- Convert categories to numbers\n",
    "- Scale playtime and age to same range\n",
    "- Handle missing age values"
